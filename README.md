# ML_project
The final project in my university's ML class. We were free to choose our topic and this project's topic is about Fake News detection and classification. 

The dataset include news articles that were classified as true or fake. 

The work concentrates on preprocessing the data (cleaning, tokenizing, stop-word removal, stemming and more) and then building different models to predict whether or not an article would be fakew or real news.

**Structure**

- data: no files because they were all too large
- notebooks:
